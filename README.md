# URL Normalizer (v1.4)

Provides URL normalization (rewrite) features for migrating a Joomla site from one domain to another and/or from HTTP to HTTPS (or vice versa).

This system plugin for Joomla will rewrite all internal (and some common external) URLs to match your settings. URLs from YouTube and Vimeo (used in <iframe> embeds) will be re-written to use HTTPS.

It also features:
- flexible client-side caching header setup (with component exclusions)
- rewrite the HTML markup (output) by using the PHP Tidy library, adapted for HTML5


## COMPATIBILITY
The plugin works with PHP5 and PHP7.

It is fully compatible with Joomla versions 1.5, 2.5 & 3.x.
